\f0\fs24 \cf0 Taking the subway to see the Museum of Modern Art. This is my first time navigating alone and I hope I don\'92t get lost. I don\'92t want to stand out. That\'92s the game you play when you travel - try not to look like a tourist. I\'92m not sure what the prize is if you win. Being smug, I suppose. Looks like a melted chocolate bar (hopefully) on the seat across from me, and a man just sat right on it without looking down first. }
